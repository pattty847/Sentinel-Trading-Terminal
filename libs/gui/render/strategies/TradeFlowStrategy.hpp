/*
Sentinel — TradeFlowStrategy
Role: A concrete render strategy that visualizes individual trades on the chart.
Inputs/Outputs: Implements IRenderStrategy to turn a GridSliceBatch into a QSGNode tree.
Threading: Methods are called exclusively on the Qt Quick render thread.
Performance: Creates a new child QSGNode for each trade, potentially creating many nodes.
Integration: Instantiated and managed by UnifiedGridRenderer as a pluggable strategy.
Observability: No internal logging.
Related: TradeFlowStrategy.cpp, IRenderStrategy.hpp, UnifiedGridRenderer.h, GridTypes.hpp.
Assumptions: Each cell in the input batch represents an individual trade to be rendered.
